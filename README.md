# Asus ZenBook Duo Integration for GNOME

This GNOME extension adds controlls to Quicksettings, allowing brightness change for second screen of Asus ZenBook Duo.

This is a fork of [mjollnir14/gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo](https://github.com/mjollnir14/gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo) and [lunaneff/gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo](https://github.com/lunaneff/gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo), since both repositories seem to be abandoned.

## Installation

This extension requires the [asus-wmi-screenpad](https://github.com/Plippo/asus-wmi-screenpad) kernel module, please install this first.

[![Get it on GNOME Extensions](https://github.com/andyholmes/gnome-shell-extensions-badge/raw/master/get-it-on-ego.png)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4607/asus-zenbook-duo-integration/)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/laurinneff/gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo.git
cd gnome-shell-extension-zenbook-duo
make install
```

## Usage

This extension will add a second brightness slider to Quicksettings (where your volume/wifi/... toggles are) to control Screenpad brightness.
It will also add functionality to some of your Asus hardware keys like Toggle-Screenpad and MyAsus key.

It will **not** link the brightness hardware keys to Screenpad display (as of now).

## Debugging

Test if brightness can be set to screenpad at all

```
echo 255 > '/sys/class/leds/asus::screenpad/brightness'
```

This should have set screenpad brightness to max (or less if you replace 255 by lower value). If this is not working, check the kernel module mentioned above.
